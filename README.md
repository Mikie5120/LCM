# Regulators of early maize leaf development inferred from transcriptomes of LCM-isolated embryonic leaf cells: supplementary material

## Contents
### Figure 3. Expression profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pre-Kranz and pre-M cells.

The code is written in Python and deposited in code folder.
For runing the code, the command line is
```python
python clusterplot.py LCM_normalized_RPKM.txt DEGs_list.txt DEG_cluster.csv DEG_cluster.png gene_cluster.txt
```
where LCM_normalized_RPKM.txt and DEGs_list.txt are input data and deposited in data folder, and the last three arguments are output data.

### Figure 4. WGCNA (weighted gene co-correlation network analysis)
The code is  deposited in WGCNA and data are in WGCNA profile.
